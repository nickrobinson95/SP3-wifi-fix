# SP3-wifi-fix
Script that resets the wifi devices in the kernel after each team the device sleeps.
This must be placed in /lib/systemmd/system-sleep/ and be made executable.
This is a personal backup of the script from a tutorial/forum thread I found online to fix the issue here https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/comments/8t7b8r/solved_wifi_issues_on_loading_from_sleep_ubuntu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
